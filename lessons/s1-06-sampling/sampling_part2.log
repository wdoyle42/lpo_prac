> Complex survey designs: Cluster sampling and stratification
> -----------------------------------------------------------
> 
> In the NCES surveys you'll be using this semester, the designers combined a design that 
> includes multistage cluster sampling with stratification. In ECLS, for example, the desi
> gners designated counties as *PSUs*. They next stratified the sample by creating strata 
> that combined census region with msa status, percent minority, and per capita income. Th
> ey then randomly selected schools within each *PSU* (schools were the *SSUs*) and then r
> andomly selected kindergarteners within each school (students were the *TSUs*). They the
> n created two strata for each school with Asian and Pacific Islander students in one str
> atum and all other students in the other. Students were randomly sampled within this sec
> ond stratum. The target number of children per school was 24.
> 
> Weights in complex survey designs such as the one employed with ECLS are calculated via 
> the same that we discussed in the last lecture. Nothing changes except for the layers of
>  complexity. The good news, however, is that we a researchers don't have to compute the 
> weights ourselves. Instead, we can use information provided by the survey makers.
> 
> The *PSUs* that are provided by NCES are what is known as "analysis *PSUs*". They aren't
>  the identifier for the actual school or student. Instead, they are allocated within str
> ata (many times 2 *PSU* per strata). Strata themselves may be analysis strata, that is, 
> not the same strata that were used to run the survey. Oftentimes, this is done in servic
> e of further protecting the anonimity of participants. As far your analyses go, the end 
> result is the same, but sometimes this can be a source of confusion.

> Variance estimation in complex survey designs
> ---------------------------------------------
> 
> There are four common options for estimating variance in complex survey designs:
> 
> 1.  Taylor series linearized estimates
> 2.  Balanced repeated replication (BRR) estimates
> 3.  Jackknife estimates
> 4.  Bootstrap estimates
> 
> Remember that these are all estimates: you cannot directly compute the variance of quant
> ities of interest from complex surveys. Instead, you must use one of these techniques, w
> ith trade-offs for each. We'll be using a couple of datasets for this lesson:
> 
> -   *nhanes*, which is a health survey conducted using a complex survey design that come
> s with a variety of weights
> -   *nmihs\_bs*, which is a survey of births that comes with bootstrap replicate weights
> 
> Let's start with the *nhanes* dataset from which we'd like to get average height weight 
> and age for the US population. First, let's get the naive estimate:

> The basic intuition behind a linearized estimate is that the variance in a complex surve
> y will be a nonlinear function of the set of variances calculated within each stratum. W
> e can calculate these, then use the first derivative of the function that would calculat
> e the actual variance as a first order approximation of the actual variance. This works 
> well enough in practice. To do this, you absolutely must have multiple *PSUs* in each st
> ratum so you can calculate variance within each stratum.
> 
> This is the most common method and is used as the default by Stata. You must, however, h
> ave within-stratum variance among *PSUs* for this to work, which means that you must hav
> e at least two *PSUs* per stratum. This lonely PSU problem is common and difficult to de
> al with. We'll return the lonely PSU later.

> The most common problem that students have with complex surveys is what is known as "lon
> ely *PSUs*." When you subset the data, you may very well end up with a sample that does 
> not have mutliple *PSUs* per stratum. There are several options for what do in this case
> :
> 
> -   Eliminate the offending data by dropping strata with singleton *PSUs*. This is a ter
> rible idea.
> -   Reassign the *PSU* to a neighboring stratum. This is okay, but you must have a reaso
> n why you're doing this.
> -   Assign a variance to the stratum with a singleton *PSU*. This could be the average o
> f the variance across the other strata. This process is also known as "scaling" and gene
> rally is okat, but you should take a look at how different this stratum is from the othe
> rs before proceeding.
> 
> The svyset command includes three possible options for dealing with loney *PSUs*. Based 
> on the above, I recommend you use the {c 96}singleunit(scaled){c 96} command, but with c
> aution and full knowledge of the implications for your estimates.

> Design Effects
> ------------------
> 
> Design effects are pretty old-school and shouldn't be used. That said, you
> will see these used in some older articles. These were used because most statistical pro
> gramming languages weren't able to compute variance estimates 
> from complex surveys up until about 2010. As a patchwork solution, the 
> survey provider would calculate standard errors for some commonly used estimates from so
> me common variables and look at how much bigger they were than 
> naive estimates. The ratio between these would be averaged and called a design effect. F
> or instance, if standard errors from a Taylor series linearized estimate were on average
>  1.3 times as big as naive standard errors then the 
> design effect was 1.3. Do not use this approach, for hopefully obvious reasons.
