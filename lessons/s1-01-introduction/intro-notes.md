# Class Notes, 1st session


I’m going to talk a bit more than I usually do about the pedagogical structure of the class, because I want to reduce any uncertainty you might be having or feeling.  

# Pedagogy and learning goals

What is this class? 

Something like 15 years ago we recognized that there was a problem in our training- students would complete coursework and being the dissertation process and then kind of . . . stall. They didn’t know how to do a research project-- they hadn’t been responsible for guiding their own research and moving it forward. We created this class to get students engaged in doing their own research from day 1. After we got started doing this we realized as a side benefit that students also were able to jump into their advisors’ research projects much more readily. 

The class is quantitative, but we really do like to think that the skills you get here translate to a wide variety of projects. This class breaks down research into a discrete series of steps and gives you a structure for undertaking research projects that you can then adapt to your own work.

The course broadly has three sections: in this semester, we’re going to handle how to get data ready for analysis and how to conduct descriptive analyses. In most stats classes, you’re given data that is assumed to be from a simple random sample, is already structured and ready for analysis. But that’s not what data look like when we get them. So-- we’ll go through the process of thinking about a question that can be asked of a given data set, accessing the data, understanding complex sampling procedures, validating your data against external sources, "cleaning" the data and then undertaking graphical and tabular approaches to describing patterns in the data. In the second semester we'll be devoted to analyzing the data using the core tool of applied statistics: regression. In the third semester we will refine and develop your research project into a paper that is at professional standards for the field. 

# Modalities

Think of this class as having four modalities:

*Final Assignment*: the end product of this course will be Stata syntax (do file, as we call it) that will access a dataset, structure it for analysis, validate the dataset against an external source, and provide descriptive statistics in both graphical and tabular format. This do file will be nicely structured and documented. You could, given time, effort and careful study of other’s code, do this on your own. Traditionally that’s how programming was taught at the graduate level. My experience is that students learn a lot from this kind of open-ended, student-driven project-based assignment. 

*Assignments/feedback/keys*: Each week there will be an assignment. I will provide brief feedback on your response, and in the beginning of each class I will create an assignment key. This part of the zoom meeting will be recorded, so you can go back through and see my explanations again if needed. In my experience, a huge amount of the learning for this class happens during the course of completing these assignments. 

*Asynchronous content delivery*: I will record brief lectures on the topics for the course for each week. These will generally involve a demonstration of some code and an explanation of what it means. These are very useful to get a narrative sense of what the code means. I will also occasionally post readings that provide similar information. I think that content delivery, while necessary, is not where most of the actual learning for this course occurs. 

*Synchronous meetings*: The typical structure of a synchronous meeting will involve me reviewing the previous week's assignment, briefly reviewing the asynchronous content, and then guided individual or group work regarding the current week's assignment. This part of the class is all about asking me questions. Really. I could teach a version of the class that just used the first three modalities and it could work. The only reason for meeting in person is to ask questions. So ask lots of questions. It's okay to ask me to repeat something I just said. Ask each other questions. Ask yourself questions. Ask questions-- the interaction around these questions is the whole point of the synchronous component. 


# Norms for working in an online environment

*Working in Zoom*

Zoom as a synchronous format for a class this size generally works very well. My basic assumption is that you will have your mic muted and your video on during class, but you can interject at any time to ask me a question or ask for clarification. If you’re having connectivity issues, first of all, don’t stress. It’s okay. The synchronous part of this class is just one part. Turning off your video is fine if you need to. Cameos from other members of your household-- partners, kids, pets--- it's fine. Don't worry about it. The main thing is to minimize any distractions that might occur for other class members, which usually just comes down to muting audio and/or video. If at any time I'm doing something that isn't working, let me know.
