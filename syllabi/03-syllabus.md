# Course Overview
The overview includes an introduction to the course, guidelines on grading, and required texts.

# Introduction
This course is the final of a three semester series of courses designed to introduce you to the practice of research, particularly the applied side of quantitative research. The goal of this course to help you to prepare a paper that can be presented at a major research conference and, hopefully, submitted to a journal for publication.

During this session, we will work as a group to refine and improve your analysis. By the end of the term, each of you will have a completed paper suitable for presentation at a major research conference.

Along the way, you will continue to develop the same set of skills you have been working on all year, along with some more specific set of techniques that I will spend the first week describing.

# Grading
Evaluation for the course will be based on the following factors:

 *Final Paper* : The final paper should be a publication-ready
  manuscript, reporting the results of the analysis conducted over the
  course of the year. You will need to turn in a replication file with
  this paper. This will be worth 100% of your grade. The paper will be
  due at midnight on June 12.

*Presentation* : You will give a presentation based on your paper on
 May 22. The presentation will be in preparation for the presentation
 you will give to all students and faculty next year. I will give
 you feedback on this presentation along with the rest of the class.

*Software*
Stata will again be the order of the day for this semester.
