Introduction
============

This course is the second of a three semester series of courses designed to introduce you to the practice of research, particularly the applied side of quantitative research. The goal of this course to help you to prepare a paper that can be presented at a major research conference and, hopefully, submitted to a journal for publication. This semester, we will focus on the analysis of the data that you compiled last semester. Prior to undertaking this analysis, you will have a chance to refine your research question, and you will be asked to compile a brief review of the literature in your area. Once this is complete, we will begin analyzing the data in your dataset. This will culminate in the final assignment—a replication file which will include all of the data and a program that provides publication-ready tables and figures. Your paper to be finished in May will be based on this analysis. Along the way, you will develop skills that will be helpful in future work using any kind of data. This class has a strong emphasis on using programming skills to aid in the replication of work and to simplify complex analyses.

Grading
=======

Evaluation for the course will be based on the following factors:

*Assignments: 33%*

There will be a total of fourteen assignments, which will be graded. Late assignments will not be accepted. These assignments will account for a third of your grade. Collaboration on assignments is fine, however, many of the assignments will ask you to work with variables and datasets of your own choosing.  The lowest scoring assignment will be removed.

*Literature Review: 33%* I will ask you to compile a brief (no more than five page) literature review on your chosen subject. This literature review, along with a revised research question, will be due midnight, February 13.

*Replication File: 34%*

A replication file containing all of the data (or links to the data) for your analysis, a codebook and your Stata program to analyze this data will be due by midnight on April 29. This assignment will be evaluated based on the following factors:

-   The quality of the underlying analysis
-   How well the replication file produces publication-ready results, including tables and graphics
-   The clarity of the accompanying text in describing the analysis in the replication file

Software
========

Stata will again be the order of the day for this semester for statistical analysis.

Texts
=====

The standard regression textbook for this department is:

Wooldridge, J. M. (2016). Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach. Boston, MA: Cengage Learning, 6th edition.

You should have a copy of this book-- 5th edition would also be fine.

A good online resource for regression with Stata is:

Chen, X., Ender, P., Mitchell, M. and Wells, C. (2003). Regression with Stata, from <http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/webbooks/reg/default.htm> .

In addition, the following texts are recommended but not required:

Mitchell, M. N. (2012) A visual guide to Stata graphics. College Stations, TX: Stata Press, 3rd edition.

Baum, C. F. (2009). An introduction to Stata programming (Vol. 2). College Station: Stata Press.

Long, J. S. (2009). The workflow of data analysis using Stata. College Station: Stata Press.

Long, J.S. and Freese, J. (2006) Regression Models for Cateogrical Dependent Variables Using Stata. College Station: Stata Press

All readings listed below are recommended but not required.

Schedule
========

Class meetings will teach specific skills that are helpful for data analysts as they seek to answer questions. Class meetings will combine some instruction with hands on practice of the skill for that week.

Students are responsible for their own projects, and I expect that you will make progress toward the final assignment throughout the semester. Office hours and/or appointments are an excellent time to discuss the direction of your project and to get feedback on completed work.
