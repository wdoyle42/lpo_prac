First of all, academic writing is *hard*. Really hard. You have to take
years of work and summarize it in a brief format for people who will
have no other engagement in the project. Most of the difficult decisions are
about what to leave out. To make it easier, we have a set of specific
structures that we use to make it easier to communicate your work. Learn
to use these really well before you think about violating them.

You should read several books on writing. Strunk and White you should
read every year. Deirdre McCloskey’s *Economical
Writing* is a great resources, as is Christopher Lasch’s *Plain Style*.

Here are some tips, in no particular order.

-   Go back to basics: make sure every paragraph has a topic sentence,
    and that each of the sentences in the paragraph support that
    topic sentence. This sounds dumb, but I see way too much academic writing that 
    doesn't follow this seventh grade rule. 

-   Use the active voice constantly. You will be amazed at what this
    does to your writing.

-   Consistent with above, make sure you can identify the subject,
    object, and verb in every sentence. Who/what is doing what to
    whom/what? E.G. “Lower test scores are associated with less use of
    proper instruction techniques” vs. “Students whose teachers use
    small group instruction score higher on end-of-year exams.” The
    first example doesn’t mention students, teachers or scoring better
    on exams, all of which are key elements to the thought
    being conveyed. 

-   It’s perfectly acceptable and indeed preferable to use the first
    person “I.” Don’t say “we” unless it’s a multiple authored paper.

-   Citations: cite every assertion of fact that does not come directly
    from the research you are reporting in the paper. This should be
    daunting at first. If it’s not, you’re probably not citing enough. 
    You're almost certainly not citing enough. Cite more. 

-   Citations: cite every theoretical proposition that does not come
    directly from your brain. Unless your name is “John Nash” this will
    constitue the vast majority of theoretical propositions you make in
    a paper.

-   More a rule of thumb: I regret every sentence I’ve written that’s
    longer than twenty words. I regret a lot of my sentences. Break up
    convoluted sentences into smaller, easier-to- understand chunks.

-   Don’t get fancy. You’ll hear this in Strunk and White and McCloskey
    and from everyone else. Most readers find rehtorical
    flourishes annoying. They’re trying to figure out what you did and
    why it matters. Save the fancy stuff for other types of writing.
    Remember Samuel Johnson: “Read over your compositions, and where
    ever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine,
    strike it out” State what you have to say plainly.

-   Organize carefully. You should be able to answer the questions: 
    Why does this section appear here and not earlier or later?
    Why is this paragraph here and not earlier/later? 
    Why is this sentence here and not earlier/later?
