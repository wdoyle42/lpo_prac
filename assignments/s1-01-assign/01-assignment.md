# Assignment 1

For this first assignment, I will ask you to describe a research question and choose a database
to work with. We will revise your research question over the coming months, so consider this
just a first draft. For next week, write a one page summary that contains the following:

  - A problem statement: what is the issue, why is it important?

- A research question: ask a question that will help to illuminate the problem. Your research
question should include the population under study, the unit of analysis, and the
dependent and independent variables. It should also indicate the type of research (quantiative or qualitative) and the direction of the relationship between dependent and independent variables. 

- The data that you wish to use to analyze this question, and if possible, some of the specific
variables which you would like to use.

As mentioned, I will ask you to revise this substantially over the course of the semester, so at
this point, just do your best to create such a statement.

You will need to know about the questions that were asked to develop the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Program, the Education Longitudinal Study, the High School Longitudinal Study
or the Programme for International Student Assessment, or another dataset you might want to work with. The questionnaires are here:

- ECLS[http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/instruments2011.asp](http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/instruments2011.asp) 
- ELS [http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/questionnaires.asp](http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/questionnaires.asp)
- HSLS [http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/questionnaires.asp](http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/questionnaires.asp)
- PISA [http://pisa2012.acer.edu.au/downloads.php]

Taking a look at these questionnaires will help to give you an idea of which research questions
you may be able to answer using these databases.
During the next week, you also should ensure that you have access to Stata and the relevant
data:

-  ECLS [http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/dataproducts.asp/](http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/dataproducts.asp/)
-  HSLS [http://nces.ed.gov/edat/](http://nces.ed.gov/edat/)
-  ELS [http://nces.ed.gov/edat/](http://nces.ed.gov/edat/)
-  PISA [http://pisa2012.acer.edu.au/downloads.php](http://pisa2012.acer.edu.au/downloads.php)
  
You will need your selected dataset to complete assignments for the course. The first assignment
based on these will be due in two weeks. The file should be named as
follows:

  `01_assignment_<lastname>.docx`
  
So, for instance, if I was completing this assignment I would name it:

`01_assignment_doyle.docx`


Notice that I have removed `<lastname>` and substituted `doyle`.  Please no upper case letters in filenames, ever. 

All subsequent files to be turned in should be named the same way.
