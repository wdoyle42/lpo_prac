Replication File Assignment

Your replication archive for your study is due 4/29/18. The file should be submitted to me via Brightspace in zip format, with all of the following components:
1. Every replication fileshould include a "readme" ̇document, helpfully titled  "readme.txt" The document should be in a platform neutral format, such as plaintext or pdf. This
should contain a description of all of the other files, including instructions on how to use the files included. DO NOT USE MICROSOFT WORD FORMAT FOR THIS DOCUMENT.

2. Another plaintext or pdf document that details the source data that the do files will require. Although I should have this data and know where to get it, this file should assume neither. DO NOT USE MICROSOFT WORD FORMAT FOR THIS DOCUMENT.

3. All of the programs used to analyze the data should be included. The syntax or programs used should include every step you took to get from the raw data to your results. These should be heavily annotated, and should note the places in the code that generate the results in your tables and figures. I will run this code against my data. I expect that I should only change the directory assignment (where the data are located) and the rest will run cleanly. The output should appear on my computer as a result of running the do file, with no intermediate steps.

4. A codeboook for variables in your analysis. You can use the NCES generated codebooks, but remember that I am primarily interested in understanding the variables that feed into your final analysis.

5. As mentioned above, all of these items should be compiled in a .zip file and submitted before the deadline.
